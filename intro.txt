2. what is validator?

  Validators run full nodes, participate in consensus by broadcasting votes, commit new blocks to the blockchain, and participate in governance of the blockchain. Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators. A validator’s voting power is weighted according to their total stake.

3. What is a full node?
  A full node is a program that validates the transactions and blocks of a blockchain. Validators must run full nodes. Full nodes require more resources than light nodes, which only processes block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full node means you are running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the Terra Core software with low network latency and no downtime.

4. What is staking?

  they are staking. Staking increases a validator’s weight, which helps them, and in return delegators get rewarded.
  A blockchain validator is someone who is responsible for verifying transactions on a blockchain
  This mechanism helps secure the network by imposing the need to lock up value in the network in order to participate in the consensus decisions.
